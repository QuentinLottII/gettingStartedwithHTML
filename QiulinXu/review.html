        <h1> Qiulin "Guxue" Xu </h1>
        <p> Qiulin "Guxue" Xu is a Chinese Player who plays professional Overwatch for the team Huangzhou Spark. Guxue plays main tank and was very well known in both the Chinese and International scene for his outstanding in game mechanics. </p>
        <h2> History </h2>
        <p> Xu began his Overwatch career in mid 2017, playing for a Chinese team LGD Gaming in the game's tier 2 scene known as "Overwatch Contenders".
        During his time on LGD Gaming, he did extremely well and helped his team finish in multiple second place finishes. Eventually, he was able to catch the eye Xingrui "RUI" Wang, an Overwatch League head coach who was coaching China's World Cup Team in 2018.
        RUI invited Xu to tryouts for the national team, in which Xu secured the main tank spot. In the Bangkok Group Stage qualifiers for the 2018 Overwatch World Cup, this young and seemingly no named player surprised the world with his mechanics. It seemed like if he kept this up, he'd have a bright future ahead of him.</p>

        <h3> Overwatch League </h3>
        <p> Guxue joined one of the eight expansion teams, the Hangzhou Spark, on November 11, 2018. Despite being a team based in China, he was only one of two Chinese players on the roster. The rest were Korean.
        With this in mind, Xu had to overcome language barriers if he wanted any chance to start. So he began learning Korean.
        Guxue had to compete with a player known as "NoSmite" for the main tank spot, in which he eventually got it. Although he looked shaky when he was first starting, Guxue was able to bring himself back to the form he was at in the World Cup. </p>
        Now, the Spark sit within the top 6 out of 20 teams in the league.
         I chose Guxue for this as I play the same position in Overwatch [Main tank] and wish to learn how to improve. Watching good main tank players like Guxue helps with that.
        Fun fact: "Guxue" translates to "Lonely snow" in Chinese. </p>
