        <h3> My favorite lyrics </h3>
        <p> "Faith is just another worthless sign. I will live my life as godless soul. Gang-star."</p>
        <p> "My fear is gone. It is gone. Only rage, is left within my faithless world. Since I have betrayed my god."</p>
        <p> "All is gone, now revenge. This fate is mine. I will survive on my own, this is my way to stay gold." </p>
        <p> "Fight with me, there is no hope I've tried. Won't give up, this is my destiny. Don't care, don't you ever give me mercy. When my life is gone with the wind, will a prayer vanish it into dust? Hell no! Starting over, Golden Wind." </p>
